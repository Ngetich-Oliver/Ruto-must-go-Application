  <ol className="scandal-list">
  <li> <strong>June 25th Masscare : </strong>On June 25th,2025 when patriotic youth of the republic of Kenya went to the street to oppose a punitive finance bill 2024, endemic corruption and opulence from their representatives they did not know what the demon had planned for them.He was  thirsty and baying for their blood.Ruto slaughtered more than 60 young people on the premises of Parliament building.What subsequently followed was a threat and refferences to the Gen-Z as criminal.The cold blooded murderer  did not stop there,what folowed were abductions and mass disappearance of young people who later popped up in quaries as dead bodies,others inquarries and City Mortuary,tortured and mutilated.Futhermore he went against the constitution and deployed the KDF on the streets.

  <li><strong>Assasination of Staff : </strong>
   The guy above after carrying out criminal deals with arms dealers,DCI  was close to nabbing him.Key security detail was to write a statement wityh detectives.That however did not happen,Sergeant Kipyegon Kenei was assasinated in cold blood and up to today when he is in power,no explanation has been provided to the family.One of his photographers also committed 'suicide' after losing his camera ,which maybe contained senstitive of the thief doing dirty deals with fellow oligarchs and criminal syndicates.Furthemore,Jacob Juma who had alleged that William Ruto was obsessed with killing him was brutally assasinated on the road and no killer was ever apphrehended and he was never questioned despite being a person of interest.</li>
  <li><strong>Angata Barikoi Killings : </strong> In continuation of His insatiable greed,the man William Samoei Ruto sent GSU officers to evict Kipsigis people from their ancestral land leading to clashes which killed atleast 5 people.Ironically these people not only voted for him forcefully but also members of the larger community in which Kasongo hail,the bastard knows no limits.</li>
  <li> <strong>Extra-Judicial Killings : </strong> Since his assumptions of power the man has ramped up extra judicial killings,using his henchmen led by Eliud Lagat,the former Deputy Inspector General.Devil Ruto has become intolerant to criticism,he and his team have brutalized bloggers and normal citizens for critizing them,one of the latest victims of the regime's brutality was Comrade Albert Ojwang who was brutally murdered at the Central Police Station on the orders of the Deputy Inspector General Eliud Lagat.Albert was his fathers only son and had one child,trullly the regime knows no bounds.</li>
  <li><strong>June 25th Anniversary and Saba Saba Killings : </strong>In memory of the fallen comrades during the June 25th 2024,comrades of the revolution came out on 25th June 2025 to protest continued police brutality and abductions and demand justice for the fallen heroes. Insted of listening to them,the criminal regime responded with brutal force leading to further killings of 18 comrades. This continues to addd salt to injury,the regime has irretrievably lost it. Further,on Saba Saba Day which commemorates the 1990 pro democracy,the revolutionary youth of this country came out in numbers across the country to protest the same issues they have been raising. Ruto and his criminal regime decided to bar people from accessing the CBD by blockading roads and deploying brutal police force.This further let to shooting of peaceful protestors,the criminal and coward regime is in the brink of collapse due to it being insecure.
