      <h2> Abuse of Office of The President</h2>
      <p> The president has in his 3 years in power engaged in various acts that contradicts the constituion of Kenya, which is supreme an thus contribute o gross violations;</p>
      <ol className="scandal-list">
        <li> <strong>Conflict of Interest : </strong>Kasongo since the assumption of power has through his family,sons and daughters engaged in arm-twisting various government agencies to trade with them or approve their business license without proper procedures. One of it being his son's public transport bus Manifest flouting the trafffic rules and no action being taken despite evidence of violations happening in a broad daylight.Furthermore he and his Nigerian son in law have acquired Sidian bank controversially therefore threatening existence of Kenya Commercial bank.He also forces government agencies to do conferences at Weston Hotel,where of course he is the owner in order to make more money in addition to using AMACO to milk government cash via African Merchant Assurance Limited,AMACO which insures government vehicles.</li> 
        <li> <strong>Violation of the Constitution : </strong> The president has violated the constitution by creating Office of the Prime Cabinet Secretary and appointing Musalia Mudavadi to the position,which is not provided for in the constitution of Kenya 2010. This is a clear violation of the law and an abuse of power.He has further created advisory roles which are not outlined in the constitution and thereby causing taxpayers millions of shillings in losses as salaries to the zealots 'advising him' despite being a known fact that Kasongo advises his advisors how to advise him rendering the  advisory roles useless.The bastard is also in contempt of court by appointing IEBC commissions despite the High Court suspending their appointments</li>
        <li><strong>Personal Foreign policy : </strong> The bastard has been continously conducting his foreign policy through the lens of personal business interest rather than the nation's. He has recently recognized the indepence of Kosovo which is part of Serbia due to his close relationship ,both in business and on a personal level with both former and current president of Kosovo.The man also aligns with the genocidal Rapid Support forces in Sudan which has killed millions of people in Sudan. That is because he has ties to gold smuggling interest with the head of the Janjaweed militia Mohammed Hamdan Daggalo.</li>
        <li><strong>Abductions : </strong> Demon Ruto has been the main cause of Abduction of Kenyans who criticise him on social media.He is too angry that Kenyans wish him death as soon as possible and have been using AI to place him in coffins.He is even angry that they made silhouttes of him. Man's has a thin skin and his has been using his power to demand arrest and abduction of bloggers and ordinary citizens.</li>
